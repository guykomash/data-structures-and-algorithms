# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. It is a practice project aimed at gaining hands-on experience with these fundamental concepts.

## Data Structures

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Heaps**
  - Maximum Heap
  - Minimum Heap
- **Queues**
  - Max Queue -> queue with getMax() in O(1)
- **Graph**

## Algorithms

- **DFS**
- **BFS**
